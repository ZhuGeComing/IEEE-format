The vibration signals for four conditions of rolling element bearing are acquired from a customized bearing test rig under variable load conditions. Seventeen statistical features are extracted from wavelet coefficients of the denoised signals. Feature selection is performed using singular value decomposition and kernel Fisher discriminant analysis. These selected features are used in these three approaches to develop health indices. Finally, a comparison of the three proposed approaches is made to select the best approach which can be effectively used for fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings. }

In this work, an empirical model based on the physical degradation behavior of lithium-ion batteries is developed. Model parameters are initialized by combining sets of training data based on DST. BMC is then used to update the model parameters and predict the RUL based on available data through battery capacity monitoring. As more data become available, the accuracy of the model in predicting RUL improves. Two case studies demonstrating this approach are presented."

abstract = {Abstract Prognostics, in other words, remaining useful life (RUL) estimation is a core task of prognostics and health management (PHM). Reliable RUL predictions can reduce maintenance costs, improve production efficiency, and avoid unexpected downtime. Lots of models for RUL predictions have been proposed; however, noise and the nonlinear nature of degradation phenomena often leads to poor prognostics results, and the acquired engineered system data are usually subject to a high level of uncertainty. This makes the RUL estimation models less than satisfactory. Accurate RUL estimation and prediction not only rely on an accurate model but also depend on the adjustments of model parameters to track the variation. In this paper, an ensemble model combining the health index synthesis (HIS) approach and improved particle filtering (PF) is introduced. HIS approach was used to obtain the synthesized health index (SHI) for an engineered system with multiple sensors, which indicated the system's degradation model, while the improved PF approach was used to adjust the parameters of the degradation model obtained from the HIS approach and optimized the RUL estimation results. The performance of the prognostics approach introduced in this paper was demonstrated by using turbofan engine degradation data sets, which was supplied by NASA Ames, and results were compared with several usually used methods.},

abstract = "Lithium-Ion rechargeable batteries are widespread power sources with applications to consumer electronics, electrical vehicles, unmanned aerial and spatial vehicles, etc. The failure to supply the required power levels may lead to severe safety and economical consequences. Thus, in view of the implementation of adequate maintenance strategies, the development of diagnostic and prognostic tools for monitoring the state of health of the batteries and predicting their remaining useful life is becoming a crucial task. Here, we propose a method for predicting the end of discharge of Li-Ion batteries, which stems from the combination of particle filters with radial basis function neural networks. The major innovation lies in the fact that the radial basis function model is adaptively trained on-line, i.e., its parameters are identified in real time by the particle filter as new observations of the battery terminal voltage become available. By doing so, the prognostic algorithm achieves the flexibility needed to provide sound end-of-discharge time predictions as the charge-discharge cycles progress, even in presence of anomalous behaviors due to failures or unforeseen operating conditions. The method is demonstrated with reference to actual Li-Ion battery discharge data contained in the prognostics data repository of the NASA Ames Research Center database."

abstract = "We propose a new data-driven prognostic method based on the interacting multiple model particle filter (IMMPF) for determining the remaining useful life (RUL) of lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries and the probability distribution function (PDF) of the associated uncertainty. The method applies the IMMPF to different state equations. Modeling the battery capacity degradation is very important for predicting the RUL of Li-ion batteries. In this study, improvements are made on various Li-ion battery capacity models (i.e., polynomial, exponential, and Verhulst models). Further, three different one-step state transition equations are developed, and the IMMPF method is applied to estimate the RUL of Li-ion batteries with the use of the three improved models. The PDF of the predicted RUL is obtained by combining the PDFs obtained with each individual model. We conduct four case studies to validate the proposed method. The results are as follows: (1) the three improved models require fewer parameters than the original models, (2) the proposed prognostic method shows stable and high prediction accuracy, and (3) the proposed method narrows the uncertainty PDF of the predicted RUL of Li-ion batteries."
